# DeFi-Credit-Score-Model


Hey there! I'm Harshal  
This is my attempt to build a credit scoring model using DeFi wallet data from Aave V2. I'm still learning all this, so the code is simple, the logic is straightforward, and Iâ€™ve tried to keep everything beginner-friendly and honest.

##  What This Project Is About ##

We were given a big JSON file containing a bunch of transactions from users interacting with Aave V2. Each user (wallet) performs actions like:
- `deposit`
- `borrow`
- `repay`
- `liquidationcall` 

The goal?  
To analyze how wallets behave and give each one a **credit score from 0 to 1000** based only on how they've interacted with Aave.

## How I Broke It Down (My Thought Process) ##

### 1. **Loading the Data**
Started off by loading the raw JSON data using pandas. The file was huge, so I took it step by step â€” just looked at the keys, cleaned the rows, and kept only what I needed.

### 2. **Building Wallet Stats**
For each wallet, I tracked:
- How much it deposited
- How much it borrowed
- How much it repaid
- How many times it got liquidated
- How many total transactions it made

I stored all this in a dictionary. Felt like building a mini profile for every wallet.

### 3. **Creating Some Ratios**
To make things more meaningful, I added two key features:
- `repay_to_borrow_ratio`
- `borrow_to_deposit_ratio`

These helped me compare users fairly, even if they had very different total amounts.

### 4. **Clustering Wallets (KMeans)**
Since I didnâ€™t have any labels (like "good user" or "bad user"), I used **KMeans** to cluster them into 5 groups based on their behavior.

I sorted the clusters based on how well they repaid, and assigned each cluster a score between 100 and 1000 â€” higher score = better behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Credit Score Distribution

I made a simple chart to see how many wallets fall into which score range:

-  **0â€“300**: Risky / bot-like behavior  
-  **300â€“700**: Average users  
-  **700â€“1000**: Clean, responsible wallets

You can find more details and visualizations in the [`analysis.md`](./analysis.md) file.
